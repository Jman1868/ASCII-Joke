# ASCII-Joke
This is a simple little project I made while learning about Node JS. It uses three npm packages [*Cowsay*](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cowsay), [*Colors*](https://www.npmjs.com/package/colors) and  [*give-me-a-joke*](https://www.npmjs.com/package/give-me-a-joke).

 - Cowsay prints out random ASCII art
 - Colors makes everything look bright and colorful
 - Give me a joke is the actual text that is printed on the ASCII art
